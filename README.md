# PROJECT | Capture the Flags!

## Introduction

The Introduction should give the outside a coder a look into what your software is, why it exists, and maybe some general philosophy behind the project.

## Documentation

Documenting your code is extremely important. You may not have to worry about this now, but as your projects get more complex, people are going to need to know how to actually use your application.

This should include things like methods your program makes available, and most important code snippets showing how to use them.

This documentation can either be built into the README or linked in an external resource.

## Setup

Some projects are difficult to get up and running, or require multiple steps/dependencies. The setup or getting started section is vital in these kinds of projects.
