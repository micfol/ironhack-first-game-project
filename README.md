# PROJECT | Capture the Flags!

## Introduction

Welcome to my first game! This was an exciting first project to implement the skills I have learned in coding from my time at Ironhack.

I wanted to create a game with a theme tied into something I that I'm passionate about, travelling! So I came up with 'Capture the Flags!' where you can 'collect' the randomized flags from the Schengen Area Member States.

## Technologies

This game is built with:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

With a focus on OOP and DOM manipulation. The gameplay being mostly manipulated from OOP coding, while the splash, game play, game over, and win screens as well as the health and score are controlled with DOM manipulation. 

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

One of the biggest challenges I faced with creating this game was learning to implement randomization within canvas. In order to get my flag objects to display a new flag, I had to add a bit of code within the Obstacle constructor. As I had tried it initially, the randomizaion was getting triggered each time the animation refreshed, so instead of a smooth flag coming across the screen, a rapidly changing image was looping as the frames changed. 

I learned a lot about layering code and nesting functions with this project. This challenge offered a great opportunity to think about JavaScript logic further, and come up with creative ways to solve problems.
